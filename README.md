## Monthly Expenses and Risk Factor

This code will read the CSV file `expenses.csv`, calculate the monthly expenses and risk factor, and plot the results.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

## Usage

To run the code, save it as `monthly_expenses.py` and run it from the command line:


```
python monthly_expenses.py
```

This will create a plot showing the monthly expenses and risk factor.

## Output

The output of the code is a plot showing the monthly expenses and risk factor. The plot is labeled with the following information:

* The x-axis shows the time in months.
* The y-axis shows the amount of money spent in dollars.
* The red line shows the daily expenses.
* The blue line shows the monthly expenses.
* The green line shows the risk factor.

The plot also has a title, which is "Monthly Expenses\n1 day = 0.3 & 1 month = 30 days". The title is customized to give the reader more information about the plot.

## Additional Information

The code uses the `style.use()` function to set the style of the plot. This will make the plot look more professional. The code also uses the `legend()` function to add a legend to the plot. This will make it easier to understand what the different lines represent. The code also uses the `grid()` function to add a grid to the plot. This will make the plot easier to read.

The code is well-commented, so it should be easy to understand how it works. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Bard.
